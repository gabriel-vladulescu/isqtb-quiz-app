6.1. Tool Support for Testing
Test tools support and facilitate many test activities. Examples include, but are not limited to:
• Test management tools – increase the test process efficiency by facilitating management of the
SDLC, requirements, tests, defects, configuration
• Static testing tools – support the tester in performing reviews and static analysis
• Test design and test implementation tools – facilitate generation of test cases, test data and test
procedures
• Test execution and test coverage tools – facilitate automated test execution and coverage
measurement
• Non-functional testing tools – allow the tester to perform non-functional testing that is difficult or
impossible to perform manually
• DevOps tools – support the DevOps delivery pipeline, workflow tracking, automated build
process(es), CI/CD
• Collaboration tools – facilitate communication
• Tools supporting scalability and deployment standardization (e.g., virtual machines,
containerization tools)
• Any other tool that assists in testing (e.g., a spreadsheet is a test tool in the context of testing)
6.2. Benefits and Risks of Test Automation
Simply acquiring a tool does not guarantee success. Each new tool will require effort to achieve real and
lasting benefits (e.g., for tool introduction, maintenance and training). There are also some risks, which
need analysis and mitigation.
Potential benefits of using test automation include:
• Time saved by reducing repetitive manual work (e.g., execute regression tests, re-enter the same
test data, compare expected results vs actual results, and check against coding standards)
• Prevention of simple human errors through greater consistency and repeatability (e.g., tests are
consistently derived from requirements, test data is created in a systematic manner, and tests are
executed by a tool in the same order with the same frequency)
• More objective assessment (e.g., coverage) and providing measures that are too complicated for
humans to determine
• Easier access to information about testing to support test management and test reporting (e.g.,
statistics, graphs, and aggregated data about test progress, failure rates, and test execution
duration)
• Reduced test execution times to provide earlier defect detection, faster feedback and faster time
to market

• More time for testers to design new, deeper and more effective tests
Potential risks of using test automation include:
• Unrealistic expectations about the benefits of a tool (including functionality and ease of use).
• Inaccurate estimations of time, costs, effort required to introduce a tool, maintain test scripts and
change the existing manual test process.
• Using a test tool when manual testing is more appropriate.
• Relying on a tool too much, e.g., ignoring the need of human critical thinking.
• The dependency on the tool vendor which may go out of business, retire the tool, sell the tool to a
different vendor or provide poor support (e.g., responses to queries, upgrades, and defect fixes).
• Using an open-source software which may be abandoned, meaning that no further updates are
available, or its internal components may require quite frequent updates as a further
development.
• The automation tool is not compatible with the development platform.
• Choosing an unsuitable tool that did not comply with the regulatory requirements and/or safety
standards.
